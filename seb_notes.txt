Linear SVM, same features etc. Just to get it to run

Test accuracy
Do we have a ground truth, y_true set? Our cluster outputs are out y_pred sets
y_true should perhaps be labeled, ['building', 'building'... 'car' car', 'car', ... 'fence', 'fence',... 'pole',...'tree']



(Analyse feature selection)



Overall accuracy
sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, *[, ...])

Mean per-class accuracy
sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score(y_true, ...)

Confusion Matrix
sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, *)




Plot learning curve, size of training set and Overall Accuracy, against each other.
