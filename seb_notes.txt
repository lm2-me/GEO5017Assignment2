Linear SVM, same features etc. Just to get it to run

Test accuracy
Do we have a ground truth, y_true set? Our cluster outputs are out y_pred sets
y_true should perhaps be labeled, ['building', 'building'... 'car' car', 'car', ... 'fence', 'fence',... 'pole',...'tree']



(Analyse feature selection)



Overall accuracy
sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, *[, ...])

Mean per-class accuracy
sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score(y_true, ...)

Confusion Matrix
sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, *)




Plot learning curve, size of training set and Overall Accuracy, against each other.
Plot with changing C parameter a few times. Plot with another hyperparameter change?
Plot of original label distributions in feature space.
Graph of wrongly labelled as seperate colour. Graph training set seperately too. Training set, right label, wrong label.


Make 3D graphs of features?

Redistribute features to get more evenly spread violin plots, as this may help.
Feature scaling and map data functions
