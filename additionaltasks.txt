-Violin graph for each parameter each label will be its own blob (SS)

-pick 3 sets of 3 features to visualize in graph with color based on actual label

-compare accuracy for 3 sets of 3, pick a set 4 and set of 5 and compare accuracy (LM)
Average Height, Squareness
Height, Average Height, Squareness
Planarity, Squareness, Average Height
ONE MORE SET OF 3
Height, Average Height, Planarity, Squareness
ONE MORE SET OF 5

Required:
SVM visualize learning curve and analyze (SS)
RF visualize learning curve and analyze (LM)

Testing to add class weight for a class that is commonly misclassified (YT)
Showing mis-labeled results on 3D feature graph (YT)
With the final selected parameters graph the following for RF and SVM (YT)
RF:
OA compared to n_estimator value (0 to 250)
OA compared to tree depth value (0 to 35)
OA compared to min sample split value (0 to 1)

SVM:
OA compared to kernel
OA compared to C
OA compared to Max_iter
