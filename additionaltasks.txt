Required (code done, will need to export with final feature set):
RF visualize learning curve and analyze (LM)

Testing to add class weight for a class that is commonly misclassified (YT)
Showing mis-labeled results on 3D feature graph (YT)
With the final selected parameters graph the following for RF and SVM (YT)
RF:
OA compared to n_estimator value (0 to 250)
OA compared to tree depth value (0 to 35)
OA compared to min sample split value (0 to 1)

SVM:
{done} OA compared to kernel
{done} OA compared to C
{done} OA compared to Max_iter
